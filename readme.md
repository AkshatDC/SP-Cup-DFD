## Description

This repository contains the code and resources for our entry in the IEEE SP-Cup DFWild-Cup competition. The project focuses on the detection of deepfakes in video and image data. We have developed a comprehensive pipeline that includes data preprocessing, feature extraction, feature fusion, and model training to distinguish between real and manipulated media. We're not saying our model is perfect, but it's better at spotting fakes than your average social media user.

## File Structure

The repository is organized into the following directories:

-   **/preprocessing:** Contains scripts for preparing the data before it is fed into the models. This includes tasks like data cleaning, normalization, and augmentation.
-   **/extraction:** Includes the code for extracting relevant features from the preprocessed data.
-   **/feature fusion:** Scripts for combining different features to create a more robust representation of the data.
-   **/model training:** Contains the code for training the deep learning models for deepfake detection.
-   **/models:** This directory stores the trained models.
